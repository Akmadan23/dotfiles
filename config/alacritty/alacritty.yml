# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  TERM: alacritty

window:
  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 4
    y: 4

  # Background opacity
  #
  # Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.
  # The value `0.0` is completely transparent and `1.0` is opaque.
  opacity: 0.75

  # Window title
  title: Alacritty

  # Allow terminal applications to change Alacritty's window title.

scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.

  # Scrolling distance multiplier.
  multiplier: 3

# Font configuration
font:
  normal:
    # Font family

    # Default:
    #   - (macOS) Menlo
    #   - (Linux/BSD) monospace
    #   - (Windows) Consolas
    family: Hasklug Nerd Font Mono

  # Point size
  size: 9.5

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought
  # of as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter
  # spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the
  # right, increasing `y` moves the glyph upward.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Use built-in font for box drawing characters.
  #
  # If `true`, Alacritty will use a custom built-in font for box drawing
  # characters (Unicode points 2500 - 259f).

  # Cursor style
  style:
    # Cursor shape

    # Cursor blinking state

    # Values for `blinking`:
    #   - Never: Prevent the cursor from ever blinking
    #   - Off: Disable blinking by default
    #   - On: Enable blinking by default
    #   - Always: Force the cursor to always blink
